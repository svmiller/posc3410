## Recommended Books

Pollock III, Philip H. 2016. *The Essentials of Political Analysis* (5th Edition). Washington DC: CQ Press.

### A Comment on the Recommended Books

<!-- Clemson University's bookstore has these listed as "required readings." That is a category error that is ultimately my fault. They are textbooks that I would otherwise assign as "required", and was nudged to submit to Clemson University's bookstore to purchase early into the pandemic. At the time, we all (naively) believed a few-week quarantine and a full-throated state and national government response would have been sufficient to contain the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). It was mostly sufficient in peer countries to us, ranging from Australia to Italy. However, the quarantine was half-hearted and we abandoned it (in South Carolina) after about three weeks and the state government (and majority leaders in the U.S. Senate) never bothered a follow-up response to the one it gave early into the pandemic when the COVID-19 outbreak also tanked the stock market. Now, we are in a situation where we may or may not ever meet in person after a four-week online start. -->

<!-- Toward that end, I want you to consider these textbooks as "recommended" and not "required." My rationale here is multiple. First, Clemson University is asking a lot of you, the student to pay full-price for a social learning experience at the university that you may or may not receive this semester or academic year. To be clear, most of that increasing expense for a college education that you are paying does not go to me---in fact people like me are [about the same price (inflation-adjusted) we were 40 years ago](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d10/tables/dt10_267.asp). It instead goes to all the things you do not typically price into your university experience given diminished support from the state government (e.g. administrators and capital projects). No matter, textbooks *are* a price you see and they can be quite exorbitant (especially through the university bookstore). If I can alleviate that cost for you in an extraordinary situation like this, I will. Second, and related to the end of the previous point, university bookstore markup is quite frankly obscene and I would hate to think you might also incur a shipping cost on top of that to have the books sent through a throttled (for other nefarious reasons) postal service. Third, and to be clear, I do intend to teach around these textbooks as I have in previous semesters. I assign these books because I believe they are useful. You should look into them if you'd like! Yet, quantitative methods is a unique subset of political science pedagogy where you could truly teach yourself if you had a working internet connection. Unlike other topics/fields in the discipline, political scientists who teach students about research design and methodology are apt to share their notes, lectures slides, and discuss stuff on Twitter. Coding-related inquiries are even more abundant on a place like [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). You could truly "just Google" your way through the semester if you were diligent. In light of the extraordinary situation of teaching students during a mishandled viral pandemic,  I intend to help you by giving ample clarification of what we will be discussing in a week if you wanted to take to Google or Stack Overflow to teach yourself these topics around my online (or in-person?) instruction. My feelings would not be hurt. -->

## Homeworks

These are the homework sets I ask you to complete during the course of the semester. Of note: the "prompt" contains the questions and the "script" contains the R code to execute various commands that will help you answer the question. Not all home works have R scripts. The "repository" link is the Github repo for everything. The first homework set also includes answer templates for your consideration. I offer these to students interested in learning R Markdown. Students should check the syllabus to see when each is due.
