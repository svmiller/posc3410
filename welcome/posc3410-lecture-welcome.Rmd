# Introduction
### Goal for Today

Familiarize students with the topic of the course and the instructor's expectations.


<!-- # Structure of This Course -->
<!-- ### Structure of This Course -->

<!-- 1. The logic of scientific inquiry -->

<!-- We'll give careful attention to the issue of inference too. -->

# POSC 3410 Syllabus
### Course Objectives

1. Understand concepts and how we operationalize abstract concepts for the sake of testing.

2. Delineate variables among various types, like nominal, ordinal and interval.

3. Put together a formal research design to address questions of interest in the study of politics.

4. Express why the logic of control is vital to any good research design.

5. Understand important elements of data, like central tendency and spread.

6. Become familiar with advanced topics like non-normal responses, Bayesian thinking, and post-estimation simulation.

7. Learn the `R` programming language, which should be a major addition to a résumé.

### (Recommended) Books

### Attendance/Participation Policy

```{r attenddata, include=FALSE, echo=T, results="hide"}
read_csv("~/Dropbox/teaching/attendance-grades-relationship.csv") %>%
  select(name:class,-id) %>%
  mutate(name = anonymize(name, .seed = 8675309, .algo = "crc32"),
         class = as_factor(class),
         term = forcats::fct_relevel(term,
                                     "Fall 2014", "Spring 2015",
                                     "Fall 2015", "Spring 2016",
                                     "Fall 2016", "Spring 2017",
                                     "Fall 2017", "Spring 2018",
                                     "Fall 2018", "Spring 2019",
                                     "Fall 2019")) %>%
  group_by(term, class) %>%
  mutate(maxgrade = max(grade, na.rm=T),
         grade = ifelse(maxgrade > 100, grade - (maxgrade-100), grade)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(perattend = (attendance/max)*100) -> Attend

# library(ggpmisc)

M1 <- lm(grade ~ perattend, Attend)
M2 <- lm(grade ~ perattend, data=subset(Attend, perattend >= 75))
my.formula <- y ~ scale(x, center=T, scale=F)

M1df <- tidy(M1)
M2df <- tidy(M2)
# library(ggplot2)
```

I'd otherwise go on a big spiel about the importance of attending class, but...  \shrug

\bigskip

For this semester:

- Attendance is assumed not required.
- Please make it a point to attend lectures.
- Please make it a point to be active on Canvas (for record-keeping).
- Please make it a point to participate to the best of your abilities.


<!-- Effectively mandatory: I deduct all participation points after five unexcused absences. -->

<!-- - Don't ask me how many you missed. You'll know more than me. -->
<!-- - Each class you miss coincides with an estimated `r round(M1$coefficients[2], 3)*5` points in your overall grade. -->

<!-- Be prepared to answer questions. I might assign quizzes. -->

<!-- - Quizzes will be graded/weighted against your participation grade for the semester. -->

```


<!-- ### Cell Phones, Laptops, etc... -->

<!-- Unless SDS says its mandatory, put your laptops/phones away during class. -->

<!-- - They are terrible learning devices. Take notes by hand instead. -->
<!-- - You're on Facebook or playing Pokemon Go anyway. Don't pretend you're not. -->


### Contact Policy

Email me: svmille@clemson.edu.

- Please *don't* email me at svmille@g.clemson.edu, or through Canvas.
- tl;dr: I'll still get it, but it's more hoops in order to respond.
- Simple email to svmille@clemson.edu works best.

That said, I will use Canvas for classwide emails.

### Office Hours

Email me: svmille@clemson.edu. We'll set something up.

- All "office visits" will be done via Zoom.

### Late Work/Make-up Policy

I'm otherwise a hard-ass about make-ups and the like, but... \shrug

- Please make it a point to complete tasks on time.
- Please get tested if you do not feel well.
- Please make-up assignments you miss because of extenuating circumstances, as promptly as you can.

Just please put in an honest effort, and try your best.

## Required Materials/Skills

- Ownership of (or access to) a computer/word processing program.
- The R programming language (read syllabus for more)
- Knowledge of getting journal articles from university library service.




<!-- I'm usually quick to respond to student e-mails. However, I may not if: -->

<!-- 1. You could answer your question by reading the syllabus. -->
<!-- 2. You missed a class for which there was no exam. -->
<!-- 3. You want to know what you missed for the class you skipped. -->
<!-- 4. You're protesting a grade without specific objections. -->
<!-- 	- Read the syllabus about protesting a grade. -->
<!-- 5. You want to know how many classes you missed. -->
<!-- 6. You're requesting an extension on an assignment. -->
<!-- 7. You're protesting that a late assignment is not actually "late". -->
<!-- 8. You're grade-grubbing. -->
<!-- 9. You want an extra credit opportunity. -->

<!-- ### Make-up Exams -->

<!-- **No, *and don't bother asking***. -->

<!-- - Sniffles/headaches don't count. Soldier through it. -->
<!-- - University-sponsored events/holidays count, but give me two weeks advance. -->

<!-- Students with valid excuses have one week *at the most* to make up an exam. -->

### Disabilities Policy

I'm more than happy to accommodate, but:

- The student has to take the intiative. I can't.
- Do let me know privately after class if I should expect to hear from SAS soon.

<!-- If you require the Test Proctoring Center, *schedule your midterm and final now*. -->

<!-- - I will not spend my free time watching you take an exam. -->

# Etiquette and Expectations
### My Contact Information

- *Name*: Steve Miller (as in the band)
- *E-mail*: \textcolor{clemsonorange}{svmille@clemson.edu}
- *Website*: \textcolor{clemsonorange}{posc3410.svmiller.com}

### Additional Course Materials

<!-- I don't like Canvas. I only intend to use it for: -->

<!-- - Turnitin (and grading the Turnitin assignments) -->
<!-- - Classwide e-mails -->

I do like making lectures publicly available, though.

- Check course website at [posc3410.svmiller.com](http://posc3410.svmiller.com)
- Check my Github repository (just in case): [github.com/svmiller/posc3410](http://github.com/svmiller/posc3410)

*I encourage the student to take initiative to keep track of their grade through the semester.*

### My Expectations

I come off as a bit cruel in my expectations.

- I expect a lot, and I expect a commitment from you.
- Otherwise, why bother? Your job is to become "pro-ready."

I also expect it to be a bit difficult for you.

- My philosophy: if you 100% understand something the first time you read it, you didn't learn anything.
- Read and re-read if necessary.
- Lectures should help, but they're not sufficient. You need to read.

I take seriously the "science" of political science.

- This may not be intuitive, but I'm also eager to help in-class or office hours.


<!-- ### Etiquette Concerns -->

<!-- In-class: -->

<!-- - Raise your hand and ask a question the *moment* something doesn't make sense. -->
<!--     - I do have a bad habit of talking a bit fast. -->
<!-- - *Do the reading before class*. Seriously. -->
<!-- - Resist the urge to write down every word on a slide. -->
<!--     - Listening is more important than reading in this context. -->

<!-- ### Etiquette Concerns -->

<!-- Outside class:  -->

<!-- - **Resist the urge** to e-mail me if you missed a class (for which there wasn't an exam). -->
<!--     - Short answer: you missed what was on the syllabus. -->
<!-- - Please use conventional e-mail etiquette. -->
<!--     - This is a good professional exercise for you. -->
<!-- - Knock first, even when the door is open. -->
<!-- - You may not use my office supplies. -->
<!-- - I am not a study session. Come prepared with something specific to ask or discuss. -->
