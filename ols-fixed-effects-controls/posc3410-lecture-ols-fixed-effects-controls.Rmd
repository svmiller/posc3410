# Introduction
### Goal for Today

*Add some wrinkles to the OLS regression framework.*

### Introduction

By this point, I think you could be doing your own research.

- You know what variables are.
- You know how to describe them.
- You know how to propose an explanation for variations in them.
- You know how to set up a research design to test an argument.
- You even know how to interpret a regression coefficient!

### Limitations in Bivariate Regression

However, simple bivariate OLS is never enough.

- Variables of interest in political science are rarely interval.
- Bivariate regression does not control for confounders.

This lecture will deal with those topics accordingly.


### R Packages We'll Be Using

\small

```r
library(tidyverse)
library(stevemisc)
library(stevedata) # ?election_turnout, ?anes_prochoice
library(modelsummary)
library(kableExtra) # nip-and-tuck table formatting

election_turnout %>%
  mutate(south = ifelse(region == "South", 1, 0)) -> election_turnout
```

\normalsize

# Extending OLS
## Dummy Variables as Predictors
### Dummy Variables as Predictors

Dummy variables are everywhere in political science.

- They play an important role in "fixed effects" regression.
- Sometimes we're just interested in the effect of "one thing".

### Swing States and Voter Turnout

Return to our education and turnout example: what if we're just interested in the effect of a state being a "swing state?"

- We'll follow 538's coding of "swing states": CO, FL, IA, MI, MN, NV, NH, NC, OH, PA, VA, and WI
- When *x* = 0, we have the *y*-intercept.

### R Code

\scriptsize

```{r showm1, echo=TRUE, eval=F}
M1 <- lm(turnoutho ~ ss, data=election_turnout)
M1df <- broom::tidy(M1)

library(modelsummary)
modelsummary(list(" " = M1), output="latex",
             title = "The Effect of Being a Swing State on Voter Turnout, 2016",
             stars = TRUE, gof_omit = "IC|F|Log.|R2$",
             coef_map = c("ss" = "Swing State",
                          "(Intercept)" = "Intercept"),
             align = "lc")

```

###

```{r m1, echo=F, eval=T, results="asis"}
M1 <- lm(turnoutho ~ ss, data=election_turnout)
M1df <- broom::tidy(M1)

library(modelsummary)
modelsummary(list(" " = M1), output="latex",
             title = "The Effect of Being a Swing State on Voter Turnout, 2016",
             stars = TRUE, gof_omit = "IC|F|Log.|R2$",
             coef_map = c("ss" = "Swing State",
                          "(Intercept)" = "Intercept"),
             align = "lc")
```

### Swing States and Voter Turnout

- The estimated turnout in safe states is `r paste0(round(M1df$estimate[1], 2), "%")`
- The estimated turnout in swing states is `r paste0(round(M1df$estimate[1] + M1df$estimate[2], 2), "%")` 
- The "swing state" effect is an estimated `r paste0(round(M1df$estimate[2], 2), "%")` (s.e.: `r round(M1df$std.error[2], 2)`).
- *t*-statistic: `r round(M1df$estimate[2], 2)`/`r round(M1df$std.error[2], 2)` = `r round(M1df$statistic[2], 2)`

We can rule out, with high confidence, an argument that being a "swing state" has no effect on voter turnout.

- Our findings suggest a precise positive effect.

### What About Regional Variation?

Southern states tend to have lower turnout, for any number of reasons.

- Most Southern states are safe states.
- Southern states also tend to have poorer citizens, which raise costs of voting.
- A few have larger minority populations and a gross past/recent history of votings rights restrictions.

Let's first unpack regional variation by looking at the effect of the South relative to non-Southern states on voter turnout.

###

```{r m2, echo=F, eval=T, results="asis"}
M2 <- lm(turnoutho ~ south, data=election_turnout)
M2df <- broom::tidy(M2)

modelsummary(list(" " = M2), output="latex",
             title = "The Effect of Being a Southern State on Voter Turnout, 2016",
             stars = TRUE, gof_omit = "IC|F|Log.|R2$",
             coef_map = c("ss" = "Swing State",
                          "south" = "State is in the South",
                          "(Intercept)" = "Intercept"),
             align = "lcc") %>%
  row_spec(0, bold=TRUE)

# stargazer(M2, style="ajps",
#           omit.stat=c("F","rsq","ser"), header=FALSE,
#           dep.var.labels.include = FALSE,
#           covariate.labels=c("South"),
#           title="The Effect of Being a Southern State on Voter Turnout, 2016")
```

### Southern States and Voter Turnout

- The estimated turnout in non-Southern states is `r paste0(round(M2df$estimate[1], 2), "%")`
- The estimated turnout in Southern states is `r paste0(round(M2df$estimate[1] + M2df$estimate[2], 2), "%")` 
- The "South" effect is an estimated `r paste0(round(M2df$estimate[2], 2), "%")` (s.e.: `r round(M2df$std.error[2], 2)`).
- *t*-statistic: `r round(M2df$estimate[2], 2)`/`r round(M2df$std.error[2], 2)` = `r round(M2df$statistic[2], 2)`

We can rule out, with high confidence, an argument that being a Southern state has no effect on voter turnout.

- Our findings suggest a precise negative effect.
- However, don't confuse this for a large effect. The difference is an estimated 3%.
    - This amounts to about half a standard deviation change across *y*.


## Fixed Effects in Regression
### Fixed Effects and Voter Turnout

Obviously, this last regression isn't that informative.

- It also problematically treats non-Southern states as homogenous.
- A meager R$^2$ suggests that.

We can specify other regions as "fixed effects".

- These treat predictors as a series of dummy variables for each value of *x*.
- One predictor (or group) is left out as "baseline category".
	- Otherwise, we'd have no *y*-intercept.
	
###

```{r m3, echo=F, eval=T, results="asis"}
election_turnout %>%
  mutate(regionf = forcats::fct_relevel(region, "South", "Northeast", "North Central", "West")) -> election_turnout

M3 <- lm(turnoutho ~ regionf, data=election_turnout)
M3df <- broom::tidy(M3)

modelsummary(list(" " = M3), output="latex",
             title = "The Effect of State Regions on Voter Turnout, 2016",
             stars = TRUE, gof_omit = "IC|F|Log.|R2$",
             coef_map = c("ss" = "Swing State",
                          "south" = "State is in the South",
                          "regionfNortheast" = "Northeast",
                          "regionfNorth Central" = "Midwest",
                          "regionfWest" = "West",
                          "(Intercept)" = "Intercept"),
             align = "lccc") %>%
  row_spec(0, bold=TRUE)


# stargazer(M3, style="ajps",
#           omit.stat=c("F","rsq","ser"), header=FALSE,
#           dep.var.labels.include = FALSE,
#           covariate.labels=c("Northeast", "Midwest", "West"),
#           title="The Effect of State Regions on Voter Turnout, 2016")
```


### Region Fixed Effects and Voter Turnout

How to interpret this regression:

- All coefficients communicate the effect of that region versus the baseline category.
	- This is the South in our example.
- Estimated turnout in the South is `r paste0(round(M3df$estimate[1], 2), "%")`.
- Turnout in the Northeast is discernibly higher than the South (*t* = `r round(M3df$statistic[2], 2)`)
- Turnout in the Midwest is discernibly higher than the South (*t* = `r round(M3df$statistic[3], 2)`).
- We cannot estimate a difference between the South and West (*t* = `r round(M3df$statistic[4], 2)`)

Notice the coefficient for the West is positive, but probability of observing it if there's no actual difference between South and West is `r round(1 - pnorm(abs(.4036199)/2.101534), 2)`. Kinda probable.

## Multiple Regression
### Multiple Regression

Your previous example is basically an applied **multiple regression**.

- However, it lacks control variables.

Multiple regression produces **partial regression coefficients**.

### Multiple Regression

Let's return to our state voter turnout example. Let:

- $x_1$: % of citizens in state having a college diploma.
- $x_2$: states in the South.
- $x_3$: state is a swing state.

Important: we do this to "control" for potential confounders.

### The Rationale

Assume you are proposing a novel argument that state-level education explains voter turnout. I might argue for omitted variable bias on these grounds:

- The "South" effect depresses state-level education and voter turnout.
- The "swing state" effect may explain state-level education (roll with it...) and increases voter turnout.

In other words, I contend your argument linking education (*x*) to voter turnout (*y*) is spurious to these other factors (*z*). 

- That's why you "control." Not to soak up variation but to test for effect of potential confounders.

### 

```{r m4, echo=F, eval=T, results="asis"}
M4 <- lm(turnoutho ~ percoled + south + ss, data=election_turnout)
M4df <- broom::tidy(M4)


modelsummary(list("Swing State Model" = M1,
                  "South Model" = M2,
                  "Full Model" = M4), output="latex",
             title = "Simple Models of Voter Turnout, 2016",
             stars = TRUE, gof_omit = "IC|F|Log.|R2$",
             coef_map = c("ss" = "Swing State",
                          "south" = "State is in the South",
                          "percoled" = "% College Diploma",
                          "regionfNortheast" = "Northeast",
                          "regionfNorth Central" = "Midwest",
                          "regionfWest" = "West",
                          "(Intercept)" = "Intercept"),
             align = "lccc")  %>%
  row_spec(0, bold=TRUE)


# stargazer(M4, style="ajps",
#           omit.stat=c("F","rsq","ser"), header=FALSE,
#           dep.var.labels.include = FALSE,
#           covariate.labels=c("\\% College Diploma", "South", "Swing State"),
#           title="A Simple Model of Voter Turnout, 2016")
```

### Multiple Regression

- Estimated turnout for 1) a state not in the South that's 2) not a swing state and in which 3) no one graduated from college: `r paste0(round(M4df$estimate[1], 2), "%")`
    - This seems reasonable, but recall the minimum on this variable is WV (19.2%).
    - This parameter is effectively useless.
- The partial regression coefficient for \% college diploma: `r round(M4df$estimate[2], 2)` (*t* = `r round(M4df$statistic[2], 2)`).
- The partial regression coefficient for the South is insignificant.
    - Conceivable explanation: education levels have a more precise effect and muddy the estimated negative effect of the South.
- The estimated effect of being a "swing state" is to increase voter turnout by an estimated `r paste0(round(M4df$estimate[4], 2), "%")` (*t* = `r round(M4df$statistic[4], 2)`)

## Interactive Effects
### Interactive Effects

Multiple regression is linear and additive.

- However, some effects (say: $x_1$) may depend on the value of some other variable (say: $x_2$).

In regression, we call this an **interactive effect**.

### A Real World Example

Consider this argument from Zaller (1992):

- Democrats are weakly more pro-choice than Republicans.
- However, the difference is very stark among the politically aware.

Let's use 2012 ANES data to evaluate whether there's something to this.

### Our Data


**IVs**: Party ID, political knowledge, interaction between both

- Party ID: (0 = Dem, 1 = Independent, 2 = GOP)
- Political knowledge: does respondent know who Speaker of the House is?

###

![Only 40% of respondents (n= 5,914) in the 2012 ANES data knew who the Speaker of the House was.](john-boehner.jpg)
Only 40% of respondents (n= 5,914) in the 2012 ANES data knew who the Speaker of the House was.

### Our Data

**DV**: latent pro-choice score via graded response model of favor/oppose/neither abortion if:

- non-fatal health risk to woman
- fatal health risk to woman
- woman pregnant via incest
- woman pregnant via rape
- birth defect cases
- financial hardship cases
- woman wants to select child gender
- it's woman's choice.

Emerging estimate has a mean of zero and standard deviation of one.

- Higher values = more "pro-choice."

###

```{r hist, echo=F, warning=F}
ggplot(anes_prochoice, aes(lchoice)) + 
  geom_density() + theme_steve_web() +
  xlim(-2.5,2.5) +
  labs(title = "Density Plot of Latent Pro-Choice Score (ANES, 2012)",
       subtitle = "The data were generated from a graded response model to have an approximate mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1.",
       y = "Density", x="Latent Pro-Choice Score",
       caption = "Data: ANES (2012). Data available as anes_prochoice in stevedata. Github: svmiller/stevedata")
```

### Interactive Effects

Our regression formula would look like this:

$$
\hat{y} = \hat{a} + \hat{b_1}(x_1) + \hat{b_2}(x_2) + \hat{b_3}(x_1*x_2)
$$

where:

- $\hat{y}$ = estimated pro-choice scale score.
- $x_1$ = partisanship (0 = Dems, 1 = Ind., 2 = GOP).
- $x_2$ = political knowledge (0 = doesn't know Speaker, 1 = knows Speaker).
- $x_1 * x_2$ = product of the two variables.

### A Caution About Constituent Terms

*Be careful with interpreting regression coefficients for constituent terms of an interaction.*

- The regression coefficient for party ID is effect of party ID when political knowledge = 0.
- The political knowledge coefficient is effect of knowledge when party ID variable = 0 (i.e. among Democrats).

### R Code

```{r showm5, echo=T, eval=F}
M5 <- lm(lchoice ~ pid*knowspeaker, data=anes_prochoice)
M5df <- broom::tidy(M5)

modelsummary(list(" " = M5), output="latex",

             align = "lccc")  %>%

```

             title = "A Simple Interaction Between Partisanship and Political Knowledge on Pro-Choice Attitudes (ANES, 2012)",
             stars = TRUE, gof_omit = "IC|F|Log.|R2$",
             coef_map = c("pid" = "Partisanship (D to R)",
                          "knowspeaker" = "Political Knowledge",
                          "pid:knowspeaker" = "Partisanship*Political Knowledge",
                          "(Intercept)" = "Intercept"),
             align = "lccc")  %>%
  row_spec(0, bold=TRUE)
```

### Interactive Effects

How to interpret Table 5:

- Our estimate of pro-choice scores is `r round(M5df$estimate[1], 3)` for low-knowledge Democrats.
-  $\hat{b_1}$, $\hat{b_2}$, and $\hat{b_3}$ are all statistically significant.
- When $x_1$ and $x_2$ $=$ 1, subtract `r round(M5df$estimate[4], 3)` from $\hat{y}$.
- Political knowledge leads to higher pro-choice scores *among Democrats*.

### Interactive Effects

Here's what this does for Democrats:

- $\hat{y}$ for low-knowledge Democrats: `r with(M5df, round(estimate[1], 3))`.
- $\hat{y}$ for high-knowledge Democrats: `r with(M5df, round(estimate[1] + estimate[3]*1, 3))`.

What this does for Republicans is arguably more interesting.

- $\hat{y}$ for low-knowledge Republicans: `r with(M5df, round(estimate[1] + estimate[2]*2, 3))`.
- $\hat{y}$ for high-knowledge Republicans: `r with(M5df, round(estimate[1] + estimate[2]*2 + estimate[3]*1 + estimate[4]*2, 3))`.

You see a huge effect of political knowledge on Democrats and, perhaps, no large (or even discernible) effect on Republicans.

# Conclusion
### Conclusion

This chapter is the culmination of everything discussed previously.

- It's basically what quantitative political science is.

Regrettably, we can only use OLS for interval-level dependent variables.

- We rarely have that.
- Next, we'll discuss what to do with non-normal responses.
